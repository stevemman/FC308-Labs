# FC308-Labs💻 
## Welcome! 👋  
This is a repository where you can find solutions for the lab sessions of the module __FC308 - Information Technology__. We created this repository with the intention of providing help to students that are new to programming and also give sample answers to each question from the lab sheets. That being said, these solutions __should not__ be considered as the only true answer to each question, on the contrary in programming there are multiple ways to solve a problem so feel free to __modify__ the code and __experiment__.  

In every file you will find helpful comments that will explain the program line-by-line, guide you through the code, as well as in some cases provide alternative approaches to a problem.
